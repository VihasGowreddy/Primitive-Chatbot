After searching the arena and many of its employees, the jersey wasn't recovered.After trying a young fan's replica Jordan jersey failed to fit, the team's equipment manager salvaged an extra uniform the team had in case of emergency. The replacement had no name on the back and bore the number 12."That has never happened to me before,'' Jordan told the Orlando Sentinel at the time. ''It's pretty irritating because you're accustomed to certain things and you don't like to have things misplaced.''It's rumored that Jordan refused to sign autographs in Orlando after the incident, which is surprising, since he's never shown any indication of being someone who holds a grudge.Jordan ended up scoring 49 points in the game, although the Bulls would lose 135-129 in overtime.About Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Licensing & Reprints Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Reviewed Jobs Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall Storytellers¬© 2021 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.

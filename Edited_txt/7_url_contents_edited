he won both the Defensive Player of the Year Award and the Most Improved Player Award in 1986.He was also selected to one All-NBA Team, four All-Star Games, six consecutive All-Defensive Teams.[56] Both Robertson and Olajuwon are among only four players in NBA history who have ever achieved the extremely rare feat of recording a quadruple double.Two other players from this draft, ninth pick Otis Thorpe and eleventh pick Kevin Willis, were also selected to one All-Star Game each.[57] Willis also had one selection to the All-NBA Team.[58] Rick Carlisle, the 70th pick, became a coach after ending his playing career and won the Coach of the Year Award in 2002 while coaching the Detroit Pistons.In 2011, he coached the Dallas Mavericks to an NBA Championship.[59]The Trail Blazers selection of Sam Bowie (left) over future Hall of Famer Michael Jordan (right) would become a noteworthy moment in NBA draft history.The 1984 draft class is considered to be one of the best in NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars.[60][61][62][63] However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history.[64][65][66][67][68] It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Star shooting guard in Jim Paxson and a young shooting guard in Clyde Drexler, whom they drafted in the 1983 draft.[50][69] Although Drexler went on to have a successful career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of the past three seasons in his college career as well.[49] Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139 games in five years with the Blazers.[70][71]Other notable selections[edit]Brazilian Oscar Schmidt was drafted with the 131st pick in the sixth round by the New Jersey Nets.However, Schmidt turned down the offers to play in the NBA and stayed to play in Italy and later in Brazil.He played in five Olympics and was the top scorer in three of them.He finished his career with 49,703 points with various clubs and the Brazilian national team, more than the NBA's career scoring leader, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who scored 38,387 points in his NBA career.[72] In 2010, International Basketball Federation (FIBA) honored Schmidt with an induction to the FIBA Hall of Fame,[73] and Schmidt was inducted by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.[74]University of Houston track and field Olympic Champion Carl Lewis, who had never played college basketball, was drafted by the Chicago Bulls with the 208th pick in the 10th round.Lewis would dominate the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in the summer of 1984.[1][75] Lewis, who had also been drafted in NFL draft of the same year by the Dallas Cowboys, stayed with his athletics career and went on to win nine Olympic gold medals and eight World Championships gold medals.[76]In the fifth round, the Portland Trail Blazers drafted Mike Whitmarsh, who starred for the University of San Diego in both basketball and volleyball, with the 111th pick.Whitmarsh played professional basketball in Germany for three years, but never played in the NBA.He then left basketball to play beach volleyball, where he achieved greater success, including a silver medal in the Olympics.[77]The final pick in the 1984 Draft, number 228 by the Boston Celtics, was Dan Trant of Clark University.Trant never played in a regular season game for the Celtics.Trant was working in his office at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and was killed in the terrorist attacks that day.[78]This draft would be the last of the NBA that would be without any undrafted players entering the NBA.Starting from 1985 onward, multiple undrafted players from each year would enter the NBA, with more of them coming after the league decreased the number of rounds from the draft from 10 to the current two.Notes[edit]^ 1: When Hakeem Olajuwon first arrived to the United States in 1981, his first name was incorrectly spelled as "Akeem".He used that spelling until March 9, 1991, when he announced that he would add an H and changed it to "Hakeem", the original Arabic spelling of his name.[47]^ 2: Hakeem Olajuwon was born in Nigeria, but became a naturalized United States citizen in 1993.He has represented the United States national team.[53]^ 3: As compensation for the first-round draft picks traded away by the previous owner, Ted Stepien, the Cleveland Cavaliers were awarded extra first-round draft picks in the 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 drafts in exchange for cash.[6][79]^ 4: Even though Tim McCormick was a senior, he had one year of college eligibility remaining and thus had to apply for early entry.[7]^ 5: Stuart Gray was born in the Panama Canal Zone which was controlled by the United States.He has represented Panama national team.[80]See also[edit]List of first overall NBA draft picksReferences[edit]General"Complete First Round Results 1980–89".NBA.com.Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.

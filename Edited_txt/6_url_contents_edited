SunsFebruary 15, 2002Wins and losses[edit]During his time in the NBA, the Chicago Bulls teams on which Michael Jordan played set numerous league records for winning, both in the regular season and postseason.However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.The longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).The longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989).This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.The longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).The longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996.At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history.It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.The Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons.It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.See also[edit]List

they shared an agent, Arn Tellem, at one time.Bryant arrived and before long, he and Jordan were dissecting every nuance of each other’s game.In the end, they decided that Jordan would have a slight edge because his hands were bigger than Bryant’s.“They were playing a virtual game of 1-on-1 at dinner,” Armstrong said.“I just sat there and listened to them talk about the love they had for the game.They were so sophisticated; they were talking about footwork, how they conditioned themselves, how they would box out.The detail that they had, the respect that they had for the game … I wish I could have seen them play in their prime.”Word got out over the course of the evening that Jordan and Bryant were in the restaurant.Eventually, one got out through a back door, another through a side door, and Armstrong was left to fight off a crowd.“It was chaos,” Armstrong said.“And they were in basketball heaven.”The seventh and eighth episodes of the documentary will air May 10, with the final two episodes on May 17.B.J.Armstrong is offering perspective and analysis to The Associated Press throughout the airing of the series.He is also a host of a podcast about the seriesNewsletterToday's breaking news and more in your inboxI'm interested in (please check all that apply) Daily NewsletterBreaking News                     National SportsMilwaukee Bucks trounce Indiana Pacers 140-113 despite missing Giannis AntetokounmpoMichigan Wolverines women’s basketball team advances to Sweet 16 for 1st time in NCAA tournamentMilwaukee Brewers’ Josh Hader happy to go back to traditional closer’s roleStudy: 90% of esports scholarships go to menGreen Bay Packers re-sign cornerback Kevin KingMichigan Wolverines salvage face for Big 10 with men’s basketball NCAA Tournament win over LSU MOST READBusiness connections help NMU food pantryMarquette County baker’s dozen: 13 area players earn West PAC awards in boys basketballW.Va.: A tax-free heaven?Munising advances, Republic-Michigamme falls in MHSAA girls basketball districtsNorthern Michigan University Wildcats’ Ondrej Zach, Roberto Camera runners-up at NCAA swim finalsAP-NORC poll: Learning setbacks a top concern for parentsNewsletterToday's breaking news and more in your inboxI'm interested in (please check all that apply) Daily NewsletterBreaking News      Starting at $4.75/week.Subscribe TodayNewsFront Page NewsCommunitySpotlightObituariesSportsLocal SportsPrep SportsSports ColumnsNMU SportsOpinionColumnsEditorialLetters To The EditorLifeHouse To HomeMonday: In BusinessSaturday: WeekendSunday: Our YouthContactSubmit NewsAdvertiseContact Us Copyright © The Mining Journal | https://www.miningjournal.net | 249 W.
